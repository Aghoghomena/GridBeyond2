# GridBeyondAgain
 An MVC .net web application to read excel files
SETUP
1.	Fork the app from the github or download the zip file
2.	There are two ways of running the file either you open the project on visual studio preferably 2017 and run the project
3.	The second method is the docker installation which I am still working on and will update once I am done

USERGUIDE
1.	On load of the project, it takes you to an home page for users to upload the sample csv file 
 
2.	on click of the upload file button which loads the data in graphs and tables for users to have a general overview of the data in the csv file
 
 
3.	There is a date range filter for the graphs and aggregates loaded.
